# ASP.NET Core Identity in a Clean Architecture


This solution provides a starting point to build any type of client (Razor pages, Web API, Angular, etc.) to work with ASP.NET Core Identity using .NET 7 and PostgreSQL, based on Clean Architecture and repository design pattern.

Clean Architecture is promoted by Microsoft on their .NET application architecture guide page. The e-book written by Kamran Nemati www.kamrannemati.ir is very well written and explains in detail the benefits of using Clean Architecture. For more details, please see [Architect Modern Web Applications with ASP.NET Core and Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/).
